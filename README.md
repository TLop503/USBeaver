> Slides from DAMSEC Presentation: docs.tlop.xyz/slides/USBeaver.pdf

The USBeaver project aims to provide a simple and educational platform for building scripted HID devices. These tools can be used to execute paylaods autonomously during authorized pentests, or as a multitool for sysadmining headless systems with physical access.

These code snippets and demos assume you are using a Raspberry Pi Pico 1 with CircuitPython. The general theory outlined here should work for any HID-capable microcontroller, but you may need to adjust the code to fit your needs.

This tool is NOT intended or authorized for malicious use. Only use the USBeaver on systems you have explicit consent to interact with. This repository is provided with no warranty or responsibility for your actions. Be smart, and Happy Hacking!
